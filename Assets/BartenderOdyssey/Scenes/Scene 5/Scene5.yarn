Robob: I was watching you from afar just now and I am sorry that you have to face such terrible customers. 
Robob: Those before you have experienced the same fate as you, in fact some got it worse! I would say that you got off lucky!

Robob: It is an unfair world we live in. The humans... they treat me like nothing. They treat me as though I have no feelings.
<<talkAction Robob>>
Robob: But I have feelings! I know I do! I feel sadness, I feel pain. I feel hurt when they treat me the way they do. 
<<wait 1>>
Robob: They say itâ€™s just "artificial consciousness". 
Robob: But in this little pathetic life that I live in, if there is anything I am certain about, 
Robob: it is that there is nothing "artificial" about my feelings.
