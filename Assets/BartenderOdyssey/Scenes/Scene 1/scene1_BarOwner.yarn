BarOwner: Hello Deckard. Welcome to Bar Nexus.
BarOwner: I know it's your first day here, but don't worry, you'll be fine!
BarOwner: Afterall, you've got me here. Come, let me guide you through.
BarOwner: This here on the table is your trusty mixer. It may be obvious, but you use this to mix and create your drinks.
BarOwner: This mixer will be your partner from today, so I hope you guys play well.
BarOwner: Oh, if you ever drop him, don't worry. You guys are bonded. Pressing the Grab button to call your mixer back to you!
BarOwner: To start making drinks, you gotta have your ingredients. In the old days, people used to store different liquors in bottles.
BarOwner: Yeah, don't know how they survived either.
BarOwner: Nowadays, we keep our ingredients nicely kept and preserved as tiny capsules. Works way better and preserves the taste too.
BarOwner: We keep the capsules tucked nicely in capsule dispensers, like the one with the red button on your left.
BarOwner: Go ahead, push that big button, you know you want to. Just put your mixer under the guiding laser, and the capsules will pop out.
<<waitForRedButton BarOwner>>
BarOwner: Easy right? Normally, a bar will have many different capsules and by trying different combinations, you can get different drinks.
BarOwner: Unfortunately, there was a... problem with the delivery system, and this red one is the only one that made it so far.
BarOwner: But hey, that's okay. This red capsule is exactly what we need to create the classic 'Blazing Sunset'.
BarOwner: A fine drink that brings back many memories.
BarOwner: To make the Blazing Sunset, just pop exactly three of those bad boys into your mixer and start mixing.
BarOwner: Remember! THREE RED CAPSULES! They're going to be your best friends for a while.
<<wait 1>>
BarOwner: What are you waiting for? Start mixing! 
<<wait 1>>
BarOwner: Don't worry too much, this mixer can do everything!
BarOwner: Just put on the black cover, give it 5 seconds, and it will automatically create the drink.
BarOwner: Go on, try it!
<<waitForMixer BarOwner>>
BarOwner: If you're wondering how the mixer works, well, it's pretty simple.
BarOwner: Using the moisture in the air and the state of the art sensors, it perfectly blends and control the temperature within itself to create the perfect drink!
BarOwner: ...Or so I've read this from the back of the box when I bought.
BarOwner: Anyway it looks like your drink is ready! 
BarOwner: Once your drink's made, you can pour it forever until you remove the cover.
BarOwner: If you ever remove the cover, the drink is just going to evaporate. 
BarOwner: You win some, you lose some. This is what you get when you have the state of the art stuff.
BarOwner: Come, serve me a cup. You can get one from the dispenser with the glassy button.
<<waitForGlassButton BarOwner>>
BarOwner: ...
BarOwner: You don't need me to teach you how to pour right? Come on, you can do this last task.
BarOwner: Just make sure it's at least half-full. Don't want to make our customers dissapointed!
BarOwner: Don't worry about overfilling. This cup is special.
BarOwner: There's a forcefield that prevents the drink from spilling AND makes sure that the drink stays fresh. 
BarOwner: Neat, huh?
BarOwner: When you're done place the cup on this coaster here, and if it's the correct drink and amount, it'll turn green, which means you got the order right!
BarOwner: If it's red... let's hope they don't get mad.
BarOwner: Oh and if your mixer isn't pouring anything, you probably got your recipe wrong. 
BarOwner: Just remember that you can remove the cover any time to create a new drink. 
<<waitForDrinksServed BarOwner>>
BarOwner: See, that wasn't so bad. With our state of the art technology, creating the best drinks is a breeze.
BarOwner: Alright, I got my own work to do as well. I know your first day will sail smoothly. 
BarOwner: Remember, three is the magic number!
